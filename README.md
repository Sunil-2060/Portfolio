Your Trusted Partner for Business Software That Just Works
For over 25 years, I’ve helped businesses like yours modernize operations, solve complex data problems, and automate tedious tasks. I don’t just write code; I build reliable, user-friendly tools that become the backbone of your daily workflow.
As a seasoned full-stack developer specializing in the Microsoft ecosystem, I offer a unique blend of modern application development and deep expertise in maintaining the legacy systems many businesses still depend on. My focus is on delivering clear value: saving you time, reducing errors, and giving you control over your data.

How I Can Solve Your Business Challenges:
· Modern Desktop & Web Applications: Building robust, scalable systems in C# .NET (WinForms, WPF) with SQL Server backends for inventory, ERP, and custom business logic.
· Database Design & Optimization: Expert in SQL Server and Microsoft Access. I specialize in converting outdated Access databases, fixing performance issues, and designing efficient, secure data structures.
· Office Automation & Integration: Creating powerful macros and add-ins for Excel, Word, and Outlook to automate reports, generate documents, and streamline communication.
· Legacy System Support & Troubleshooting: A proven expert in Visual Basic 6 (VB6) and older Access versions. I can take over undocumented, complex systems, reverse-engineer them, and provide stable, long-term support.
· API Integration & Data Consolidation: Connecting your software to other services, pulling data from various sources (APIs, Excel, CSV), and creating a single source of truth.

Why Clients Keep Coming Back:
· Deep Domain Knowledge: I’ve built solutions for construction, manufacturing, legal, banking, and warehousing. I understand your industry’s unique challenges.
· Clear Communication: I translate technical jargon into plain English. You’ll always know the plan, the progress, and the outcome.
· Low-Risk, High-Value Projects: I believe in starting with a clear assessment and a fixed-price roadmap. You’ll know exactly what you’re getting before any major work begins.

Let’s build something great together. Send me an invitation, and let’s discuss how I can bring reliability and expertise to your project.

The difference between a cheap developer and a senior architect often isn’t in the features you can see, but in the catastrophes you never see.
